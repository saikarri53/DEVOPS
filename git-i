1)Whatâ€™s the difference between git fetch and git pull?
Ans:
git fetch: Downloads commits, branches, and tags from the remote but does not merge them into your local branch. It just updates your remote tracking branches.
git pull: Fetches + merges the remote changes into your current local branch in one step.
