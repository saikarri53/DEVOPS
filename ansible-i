1)In Ansible, what’s the difference between a Playbook and a Role?
Ans:
->A Playbook in Ansible is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on target machines.
It’s like the script that tells Ansible what to do — install packages, copy files, restart services, etc.
->A Role is a way to organize those Playbooks into reusable components.
A Role has its own folder structure (tasks/, handlers/, vars/, templates/, etc.), so your code is cleaner and modular.
