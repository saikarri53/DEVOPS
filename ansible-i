1)In Ansible, what’s the difference between a Playbook and a Role?
Ans:
->A Playbook in Ansible is a YAML file that defines a set of tasks to be executed on target machines.
It’s like the script that tells Ansible what to do — install packages, copy files, restart services, etc.
->A Role is a way to organize those Playbooks into reusable components.
A Role has its own folder structure (tasks/, handlers/, vars/, templates/, etc.), so your code is cleaner and modular.

2)In Ansible, what’s the difference between the command module and the shell module?
Ans:command module: Executes a command on the remote host without using a shell. It’s safer, doesn’t process shell features like |, >, <, &&.
shell module: Executes a command through the shell, so you can use pipes, redirection, and shell operators.
