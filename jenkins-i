1)In Jenkins, what’s the difference between a Freestyle Project and a Pipeline Project?
Ans:Freestyle Project: A simple, GUI-based job where you manually configure each step (build, test, deploy). It’s limited and not reusable.
Pipeline Project: Uses a Jenkinsfile (code) to define the CI/CD process — allows automation, version control, complex stages, and better scalability.

2)What is the purpose of a Jenkinsfile and what are the two types of pipeline syntax available?
Ans:A Jenkinsfile is a text file that defines the entire CI/CD pipeline as code. It contains stages like build, test, and deploy — making the process automated, repeatable, and version-controlled.
There are two pipeline syntaxes:
Declarative Pipeline: Simpler, structured, and easier to read (pipeline { stages { ... } })
Scripted Pipeline: Based on Groovy, more flexible and used for complex logic.

3)In Jenkins, how can you trigger a build automatically whenever code is pushed to GitHub?
Ans: 
trigger a Jenkins build automatically when code is pushed to GitHub:
Integrate Git with Jenkins:
Connect your GitHub repo in the Jenkins job configuration.
Use Webhooks in GitHub:
Go to your repo → Settings → Webhooks → Add webhook → give Jenkins URL (http://<jenkins-server>/github-webhook/)
Now every push event notifies Jenkins automatically.
Configure Jenkins Job:
In the job, select “Build when a change is pushed to GitHub” or use a multibranch pipeline that listens to SCM changes.
Result:
Every time someone pushes code → Jenkins gets notified → automatically builds → generates WAR file or any build artifact.

1️⃣ Using Jenkins “Manage Credentials” (Most Secure Way)

This is the recommended method — Jenkins hides sensitive data safely.

🧩 Steps:

Go to Dashboard → Manage Jenkins → Credentials

Choose (Global) or create a domain

Click Add Credentials

Choose the type:

Username with password

Secret text

SSH key etc.

Enter your username and password → Save

pipeline {
    agent any
    environment {
        CREDS = credentials('my-credentials-id')  // ID from Jenkins
    }
    stages {
        stage('Show Example') {
            steps {
                sh '''
                echo "Username: $CREDS_USR"
                echo "Password: $CREDS_PSW"
                '''
            }
        }
    }
}
