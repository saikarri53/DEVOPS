4)What is the crontab in Linux? Can you provide an example of usage?
Ans:“Crontab is a configuration file that defines scheduled jobs for the cron daemon in Linux. It lets you run scripts or commands automatically at specific times — for example, every minute, every day, or on certain weekdays.
Each line in the crontab uses five time fields — minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week — followed by the command to execute.”

“If I want to run a backup script every day at 5 PM, I’d add this line:
0 17 * * * /home/harsha/backup.sh
This means ‘minute 0, hour 17, every day, every month, every weekday.’
The cron daemon will then execute the script daily at 5 PM without manual intervention.”
